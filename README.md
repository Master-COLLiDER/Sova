## IMPORTANT: This project is unfinished. Feel free to fork and make your own version or take bits of this one for something.

If you want to try it out and see what it's all about, simply upload all files (keeping directory structure) to a PHP server and create a MySQL database ready for it. Point the server to the "/public" folder.

If I ever get around to working on it some more or whatever I will update this repo.
